# Cloudflare — thenewsoulsearchers.de

Live Worker: **`thenewsoulsearchersblogc`** — owns the domain, holds the OAuth secrets, and is the `name` in `wrangler.toml`. The GitHub repo is `thenewsoulsearchersblog` (no `c`); the two are deliberately different, so do not "fix" `wrangler.toml` to match the repo name.  
Git source: **`chewbacca23/thenewsoulsearchersblog`** (`main`)  
Admin: **https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/admin/** (not `www`)  
Kit: **https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/kit** (public)

---

## Easy editor (Login with GitHub)

The public site is on Cloudflare. `/admin` saves Markdown into GitHub; Cloudflare rebuilds; the new ride or note goes live.

**First time only** — one GitHub OAuth app, then two Cloudflare secrets.

### A. GitHub OAuth app

1. Open [github.com](https://github.com) as **`chewbacca23`**
2. Photo (top right) → **Settings**
3. Left list, scroll to the bottom → **Developer settings**
4. **OAuth Apps** → **New OAuth App**
5. Fill in:
   - Application name: `Soul Searchers CMS`
   - Homepage URL: `https://thenewsoulsearchers.de`
   - Authorization callback URL: `https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/callback`
6. **Register application**
7. Copy **Client ID**
8. **Generate a new client secret** → copy it (GitHub shows it once)

### B. Cloudflare secrets — from the terminal (recommended)

Five Workers are Git-connected to this repo, so the dashboard offers five wrong places to paste the keys. The CLI targets one Worker by name:

```sh
sh scripts/set-cms-secrets.sh
```

It logs you in, asks for the Client ID and the secret, then lists what landed on `thenewsoulsearchersblogc`.

Login uses `wrangler login --device`, which prints a code you type into Cloudflare. The default flow instead waits on a `localhost:8976` callback server that exists only while the command runs, so pausing before you click **Authorize** ends in `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.

To check any time, without revealing values:

```sh
npx wrangler secret list --name thenewsoulsearchersblogc
```

### B2. Cloudflare secrets — via the dashboard

1. [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. **Workers & Pages** → **`thenewsoulsearchersblogc`** (the live journal Worker, the one with a **c** — not the shop, and not `thenewsoulsearchersblog` without the `c`)
3. **Settings** → **Variables and Secrets** — the runtime section. Values added under **Build** never reach the running site.
4. Name `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` · type **Text** · paste the Client ID → Save
5. **Add** again: name `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` · type **Secret** · paste the secret → Save

### Photos are kept under 1 MB automatically

The media library previews images through the GitHub contents API, which returns `"encoding": "none"` and no body for files over 1 MB. The upload still commits, so the photo works on the site while the thumbnail in the editor stays broken. iPhone photos are 2–5 MB and always hit this.

**The 1 MB is GitHub's, not a setting we chose.** Raising `MAX_BYTES` in `scripts/optimise-photos.py` does not raise GitHub's limit — it only stops photos being resized and brings the broken thumbnails back. The script also aims for a *web* target (~350 KB, long edge up to 1800px) so Now and home stay quick; `EDGE_STEPS` / `QUALITY_STEPS` try the largest detail that still fits that budget.

**You do not have to think about it.** `.github/workflows/keep-photos-small.yml` runs on every push that touches a photo, resizes anything over the limit, and commits the result. Upload straight from your phone; the next preview loads.

One-time repo setting for the robot to be able to commit: **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write permissions**.

Locally:

```sh
npm run photos:check   # report anything too big
npm run photos:fix     # resize them in place
```

Before uploading, on a Mac:

```sh
sh scripts/shrink-photo.sh ~/Desktop/IMG_1234.HEIC
```

Two things to know about iPhone photos: they carry your **GPS location** in EXIF, and they store the image sideways with an orientation flag. The resizer rotates the pixels before stripping metadata — do it the other way round and the photo appears rotated 90° in every browser.

### C. Write a post

1. Open **https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/admin/** (apex, not www)
2. **Login with GitHub** → authorize **Soul Searchers CMS**
3. **Ride notes** or **Rides** → New → write → **Save this ride** / **Publish**
4. Open the ride page itself (not only the list) and hard-refresh

The editor writes GitHub immediately. If Cloudflare has not rebuilt yet, the Worker still
reads that ride, its photos, and the **Shop** products from GitHub so the public page is
not blank. If a photo URL still 404s, **Workers → thenewsoulsearchersblogc → Deployments → Retry**, then
`Cmd+Shift+R`.

If the GitHub popup says login is not wired yet, secrets from **B** are missing.

### Looks (how many people opened a page)

After **Login with GitHub** in `/admin/`, open the gold **Looks** chip (or bookmark
`/looks`). It stays private: no footer link, and strangers without the login cookie get a blank
gate page. Today, last 7 days, this year, all time, which pages, which country, and which site
sent them. No visitor names. Numbers start after this Worker is live. Your own clicks count.

A Worker-only HTML page for `/looks` was challenged by Bot Fight, so the count page never
opened. The Worker now fills the numbers into the real Astro page instead.

### Looks storage (so counts survive deploys)

Looks uses Cloudflare KV binding **`STATS`** → namespace **`soulsearchers-looks`**
(`id` is in `wrangler.toml`). After a Mac-push, open
**https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/cms-status** and confirm:

- `"looksStorage": "kv"`
- `"looksDurable": true`

If it says `"cache"` or `statsBinding.present` is false, the deploy landed on the wrong
Worker, or Bindings still need a Retry on **`thenewsoulsearchersblogc`**.

### Stuck? Ask the Worker instead of guessing

Open **https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/cms-status**. It reports the binding names the live Worker can see — never the values.

| What it says | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `"textBindingsVisibleToWorker": []` | The Worker sees nothing. Keys went to another Worker, or under **Build** variables instead of runtime **Variables and Secrets**. |
| Names listed but `"loginWired": false` | Names are close but unmatched. Rename to `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. |
| `"clientIdShape": "does NOT look like a GitHub client id"` | The Client **ID** box holds the wrong value (GitHub ids start `Ov23`). |
| `"loginWired": true` | Login is ready. Go to `/admin/`. |
| `"looksStorage": "cache"` or `"memory"` | Looks is temporary. Finish the KV steps above. |
| `"looksStorage": "kv"` / `"looksDurable": true` | Looks is durable. Counts survive deploys. |
| `"mailWired": true` | Contact form can send straight to Henrik’s inbox. |
| `"mailWired": false` / `"mailVia": "none"` | Add **`RESEND_API_KEY`** (steps below), then Retry. |

### Contact form (real send, no mail app)

`/contact` posts to **`/api/contact`**. The note goes to **`henrik@thenewsoulsearchers.de`**
by default (Henrik’s laptop / Strato mailbox). Reply-To is the rider’s address.

Override with Worker secret **`CONTACT_INBOX`** if needed (e.g. temporary web.de while Strato is down).

DNS first (Resend → Domains → `thenewsoulsearchers.de`):

1. **Enable Sending** verified (DKIM + the `send` / `rsend` CNAMEs, DNS only)
2. Leave **Enable Receiving** off so Strato / existing MX keeps delivering `henrik@…`
3. DMARC on the root should be soft (`p=none` or `p=quarantine`) so Resend → Strato does not hard-bounce

#### Dashboard path (no Terminal)

Do this on Worker **`thenewsoulsearchersblogc`** only (name ends with **c**).

1. Resend → [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) → delete old keys → **Create API Key** → copy the `re_…` once
2. Cloudflare → Workers & Pages → **`thenewsoulsearchersblogc`** → Settings → Variables and secrets
3. Delete Variables named `thenewsoulsearchers` or `soulsearchers` (wrong names; unused)
4. On **`RESEND_API_KEY`**: Edit → paste the new `re_…` → Save  
   (Secret is nicer than Variable; either works. The *value* must be the fresh key.)
5. Hard-refresh **https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/contact** → one short Send → look for **Sent**

If Send says the mail key was rejected, the `re_…` value is still wrong. Make another key in Resend and edit `RESEND_API_KEY` again.

#### Terminal path (also fine)

```sh
# From the blog repo on the Mac
sh scripts/set-resend-secret.sh
```

Or one shot without the script:

```sh
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=a81e1d3b6d945aa2b872e4c8fd32f382
npx --yes wrangler@4 login --device
npx --yes wrangler@4 secret put RESEND_API_KEY --name thenewsoulsearchersblogc
```

Paste the Resend API key when asked (starts with `re_`). Then hard-refresh **https://thenewsoulsearchers.de/cms-status**:

- `"mailWired": true` and `RESEND_API_KEY` inside `textBindingsVisibleToWorker` → hard-refresh `/contact` and send a test
- Still false / key missing from that list → the secret is on a sibling Worker (`thenewsoulsearchersblog` without the **c**, or Build vars). Run the script again.

Until a **working** key is there, Send shows **Not delivered yet** (or “Mail key was rejected”) and never opens a mail app.

Notes land in **`henrik@thenewsoulsearchers.de`** by default (From `hello@thenewsoulsearchers.de`
via Resend). Reply-To is the rider.

### If Resend shows Bounced to henrik@thenewsoulsearchers.de

Your **key is fine**. Strato (`smtpin.rzone.de`) often rejects mail that is:

- **From** `@thenewsoulsearchers.de` (via Resend / Amazon)
- **To** `@thenewsoulsearchers.de` (your Strato mailbox)

It looks like spoofing to them, even when DMARC is `p=none` and DKIM is valid.

**Try DNS (Cloudflare → DNS → TXT on the root `thenewsoulsearchers.de`):**

Change SPF from:

```txt
v=spf1 include:_spf.strato.com -all
```

to:

```txt
v=spf1 include:_spf.strato.com include:amazonses.com ~all
```

(Keep Strato; soften `-all` to `~all`; allow Resend’s Amazon SES path.)

Wait a few minutes, send one new `/contact` test, check the **newest** Resend row.

**If it still bounces:** set `CONTACT_INBOX` to a Gmail (or other) inbox you open on the laptop, and optionally in Strato set a forward from `henrik@…` → that Gmail so the domain address still feeds the laptop.

Do **not** turn on Resend **Receiving** on the root domain (that steals Strato MX).

To retarget:

```sh
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=a81e1d3b6d945aa2b872e4c8fd32f382
npx --yes wrangler@4 secret put CONTACT_INBOX --name thenewsoulsearchersblogc
```

(`/cms-status` shows `mailTo` / `mailFrom` / `mailKeyProbe`.)

Check live status anytime: **GET /api/contact** returns `{ "mailWired": true/false, "to": "…" }` without revealing secrets.

Five Workers (`thenewsoulsearchersblogc`, `bloga`, `blogb`, `bl`, `blo`) are Git-connected to this repo and all serve this code. `thenewsoulsearchersblogc` is the one on the domain, so its secrets are the ones that count.

Do not force-push over `thenewsoulsearchersblog` `main` after using the editor — that would wipe those posts.

| Build output directory | `dist` |
| Environment variable | `NODE_VERSION` = `22` |

5. **Save** → trigger deploy
6. **Custom domains** → `thenewsoulsearchers.de` (+ optional `www`)

## If you already deployed from plasticparticles-shop

Your old project pointed at repo `plasticparticles-shop` with root directory **`soul-searchers`**.

**Switch it:**

1. Pages project → **Settings** → **Build**
2. Change repo to **`thenewsoulsearchersblog`**
3. Clear **root directory** (blank)
